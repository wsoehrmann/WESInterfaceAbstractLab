
Objectives for Lab #2:
---------------------
   * Practice using abstraction by creating an Interface super class and
     choosing an appropriate interface name (should be a noun).
   * Practice identifying common behaviors (methods) and placing
     those things in the super class
   * Continue practicing what you have learned about Encapsulation

Instructions for Lab #2:
----------------------
1. Create an interface super class that contains common methods
   to be inherited by the sub-classes that are provided.
2. Modify your sub-classes to take advantage of this inheritance. Will you
   need to re-implement all methods? How will you deal with common
   properties?
3. Fix any and all encapsulation problems.
4. Create a startup class to test your code. In this startup class create and
   use at least one instance of each sub-class.
5. In the startup class document what you think is good or bad about this
   architecture from the perspective of using abstraction and inheritance.
   (Remember, a startup class must have a main method)
6. In your solution when can Liskov Substitution principle be used and when
   is it not possible. Write down your anwer in this document, using the
   white space below:
