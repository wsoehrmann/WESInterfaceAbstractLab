
Objectives for Lab #3:
---------------------
   * Practice using both an interfce and an abstract class as super classes
     for sub classes of your choosing (invent something, but don't use
     anything previously used in class). Typically this would be structured
     as Interface <- Abstract <- sub-class

Instructions for Lab #2:
----------------------
1. Which should come first, the interface or the abstract class? You need
   to justify your choice by adding comments to the super classes.
2. Which super class methods should be concrete vs. abstract in the abstract
   super class? Justify your choices by adding comments to each method.
3. Which properties should be declared in the abstract super class and which
   should be declared in the course sub classes? Justify your choices by 
   adding comments to the property declarations.
4. Observe best practices for naming things: classes begin with an upper case
   letter and are singular nouns; properties begin with a lower case letter
   and use camel case thereafter and do not include verbs in the name; methods
   just have a verb in the name (action terms) and must begin with a lower case
   letter and camel case thereafter. If a method returns a value the name 
   should suggest somethig is coming back; if not, words like "get" would be
   inappropriate.
5. Provide a printed UML diagram of your code. Suggest you use LucidChart to
   create your diagrams (you should have received an invitation by email to
   join LucidChart and participate in our instructors team account).
